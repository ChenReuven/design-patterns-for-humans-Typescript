// üîå Adapter
// Explanation:
// There is an Hunter that know to Hunt ONLY Lions (he know to hunt several types of lions such: AfricaLion/AsianLion etc...)
// We want to give the ability for the Hunter to hunt also new kind of animal: WildDog!
// So we need to "adapt" the Hunter to hunt new kind of type: the WildDog
// we need to create adapter for the Hunter for that.
// The code below explain how to do it.
// future: there is also a diagram for that in draw.io
